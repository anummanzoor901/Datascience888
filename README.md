Prediction on used car has gain a lot of attention in recent year. With the growing standard of living of people many relays on second hand cars. But thatâ€™s where the cost varies a lot. Sometimes car deals take advantage and inflate the prices of second-hand cars. To make a better decision on the offered price become hard. In this project I selected three different car sale datasets from Kaggle and contains the car sales data from year 1990-2022. The records in these datasets are gathered from different sources. Humans make a lot of mistakes while entering their car records online, sometime adding high price or wrong information or missed some values. In other words, ambiguity is sometimes high. Currently the imbalance rate of these datasets is low but after making them imbalanced, we can work on the real-life problem of car sales dataset more well.
